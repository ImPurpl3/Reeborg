# Reeborg
[Reeborg](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html) is a tool used to help people learn python and OOP
In Saskatchewan, it is used by the school systems to help teach CSC20 - [OpenSask: Reeborg's World](http://opensask.ca/reeborg/?lang=en&mode=python)

# My Solutions
In [Solutions](Solutions), you will find my code for each step/world
Some of the later steps may not be optimized, but they still work

# My Worlds
I made a world called [The Big Toss](Worlds/The%20Big%20Toss.json) and it uses some advanced Reeborg functions to get to the goal
Feel free to try it out and beat my challenge
